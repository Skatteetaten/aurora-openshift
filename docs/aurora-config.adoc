== Aurora Config

Aurora Config is an opinoinated way of configuring how namespaces and applications are applied to an OpenShift cluster. 

Config files are written either as Json or Yaml. All the examples will use YAML since it is easier on the eyes. 


=== Files
Given that you have an application with name 'reference' in the environment 'dev' the following files will be present

Note that the suffix of the file can be either json or yaml
|=======
|filename       | name   | reason
|about.yaml     | global | All applications in a given AuroraConfig will inherit from it
|foo.yaml       | base   | All applications named 'reference' in all environments will inherit from it
|dev.yaml       | env    | All applications in the env 'dev' inhert from it
|dev/foo.yaml   | app    | Instructons on how to deploy the application 'reference' in 'dev'
|=======

It is possible to change the base and env file in a given app file if you want to compose your configuration.

.utv/reference.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
baseFile: foo.yaml
envFile: about-template.yaml
----

In this scenario 'foo.yaml' would be used instead of 'reference.yaml' as the base file and the 'about-template.yaml' file would be used instead of 'about.yaml'

=== Example configuration for the reference-application
Below is an example of how you could configure an instance of the https://github.com/skatteetaten/openshift-reference-springboot-server[reference application]

.about.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::auroraConfig/about.yaml[] 
----


.reference.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::auroraConfig/reference.yaml[] 
----

.dev/about/reference.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::auroraConfig/dev/about.yaml[] 
----

.dev/about/reference.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::auroraConfig/dev/reference.yaml[] 
----

The complete config is then evaluated as
[source,yaml]
----
include::auroraConfig/reference-full.yaml[] 
----

|route/<name>/path              |            |              | Set to create a path based route. You should use the same name/affiliation/env/seperator combination for all path based routes to get the same URL
